# FastWebGPUSGEMM

In this project, we seek to use WebGPU's Compute shaders to write a fast single-precision General Matrix Multiplication (SGEMM) kernel. To these ends, we develop a series of iteratively better kernels, analyze their performance, and understand their limitations. We also developed a handy benchmarking tool on the web to allow anyone to benchmark our results on their hardware.
